Check out simple crud operation with pagination in MERN stack - https://mern-crud-2024-jfc-frontend.onrender.com/

ðŸš€ Completed My MERN Stack CRUD Project!

I'm excited to share a new project I recently completed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) along with Ant Design for a sleek and responsive UI! ðŸŽ‰

This project was built to strengthen my skills in full-stack development, focusing on:
âœ… Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations
âœ… Pagination for efficient data handling
âœ… Responsive design using Ant Design components
âœ… Backend API built with Node.js and Express.js
âœ… MongoDB for seamless database operations

âœ¨ Key Features:

User management with profile pictures
Interactive forms and pagination
Modern UI with Ant Design for better usability
Deployed on Render for a live, production-ready experience ðŸš€
ðŸ’¼ I am actively looking for job opportunities as a MERN stack developer. If your organization is hiring or you know someone who is, please connect with me. ðŸ˜Š

Feel free to check out the screenshot below ðŸ‘‡ and reach out with any feedback or opportunities!
